# Advanced Quantum Theory
My notes from Advanced Quantum Theory (taught by Tobias Osborne). 
This course covers the mathematical formalism and physics of many-particle quantum mechanics (in the framework of manifolds and configuration space), as well as introductory relativistic quantum mechanics.

The video lectures are available at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDfPUNusx1Eo60qx3Od2KLUL4b7VDPo9F "Advanced Quantum Mechanics Playlist")
