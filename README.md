# Advanced Quantum Theory
My notes from Advanced Quantum Theory (taught by Tobias Osborne). 
This course covers the mathematical formalism and physics of many-particle quantum mechanics (in the framework of manifolds and configuration space), as well as introductory relativistic quantum mechanics.

Thanks to Erik Pillon and Cheung Chun Tung for their corrections.
